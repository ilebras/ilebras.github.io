**I am a sea-going physical oceanographer studying the large-scale circulation of the ocean.**

I am a postdoctoral scholar at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) working with [Fiamma Straneo](https://twitter.com/fstraneo). My research focuses on better understanding how ice and freshwater impact the circulation of the high-latitude ocean.

During my Ph.D. in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/), I examined observations and models of the Gulf Stream and the Deep Western Boundary Current, two major currents in the North Atlantic.
