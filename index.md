I am a physical oceanographer studying the large-scale circulation of the ocean and how it relates to the climate system. Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with Fiamma Straneo. I am researching the currents around Greenland to better understand how ice and freshwater impact the circulation in the high-latitude ocean. During my Ph.D. in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, I examined observations and models of the Gulf Stream and the Deep Western Boundary Current, two major currents in the North Atlantic.
