 abstract = {The OOI Biogeochemical Sensor Data Best Practices and User Guide is intended to provide  current and prospective users of data generated by biogeochemical sensors deployed on the  Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) arrays with the information and guidance needed for them  to ensure that the data is science-ready. This guide is aimed at researchers with an interest or  some experience in ocean biogeochemical processes. We expect that users of this guide will  have some background in oceanography, however we do not assume any prior experience  working with biogeochemical sensors or their data.    While initially envisioned as a ``cookbook'' for end users seeking to work with OOI  biogeochemical (BGC) sensor data, our Working Group and Beta Testers realized that the  processing required to meet the specific needs of all end users across a wide range of potential  scientific applications and combinations of OOI BGC data from different sensors and platforms  couldn't be synthesized into a single ``recipe''. We therefore provide here the background  information and principles needed for the end user to successfully identify and understand all  the available ``ingredients'' (data), the types of ``cooking'' (end user processing) that are  recommended to prepare them, and a few sample ``recipes'' (worked examples) to support end  users in developing their own ``recipes'' consistent with the best practices presented here.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive guide to each of these sensors, but rather a synthesis  of the key information to support OOI BGC sensor data users in preparing science-ready data  products. In instances when more in-depth information might be helpful, references and links  have been provided both within each chapter and in the Appendix.},
