My research is focussed on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the large-scale circulation in the Atlantic which brings warm-salty water northwards and cold-fresh water southwards. This circulation pattern is associated with heat, freshwater and carbon transports which aide to stabilize earth's climate.

As a postdoc at Scripps, I am involved in [O-SNAP](http://www.o-snap.org/), an AMOC monitoring system in the subpolar North Atlantic started in 2014. In particular, I am working with data from an array of moorings just east of Greenland, where the upper and lower limbs of the AMOC meet.
