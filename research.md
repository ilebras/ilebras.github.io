My research is focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the large-scale circulation in the Atlantic which brings warm-salty water northwards and cold-fresh water southwards. This circulation pattern is associated with heat, freshwater and carbon transports which aide to stabilize earth's climate.

# Freshwater in the East Greenland Current System

* As a postdoc at Scripps, I am involved in [O-SNAP](http://www.o-snap.org/), an AMOC monitoring system in the subpolar North Atlantic started in 2014. In particular, I am working with data from an array of moorings just east of Greenland *(red circle below)*, where the upper and lower limbs of the AMOC meet.

* From the first two years of data, I showed that the maximum freshwater transport in the East Greenland Current system occurs outside the summer, which implies that historical measurements are undersestimates. I also explored mechanisms for stirring freshwater off the shelf, which could affect convection downstream [*(paper)*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JC014511).

* I am now studying how convection interacts with the boundary current system in the Irminger Sea.

# The Deep Western Boundary Current

* In graduate school, I worked on the [Line W](http://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/linew/) project, which monitored the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) southeast of Cape Cod from 2004-2014. The DWBC brings cold-fresh water southwards at depth as part of the lower limb of the AMOC.

* Using this and all available upstream data, I quantified DWBC travel times and stirring from the Labrador Sea to Line W, weighing in on an ongoing debate over how the deep ocean is filled with water from high latitude sources [*(paper)*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JC012921/full).

* I was also involved in analysizing DWBC transports at Line W [*(paper)*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JC012984/full).

# Gulf Stream Dynamics

* Using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic process model, I investigated the interaction between the Gulf Stream and the DWBC. I found both that eddy growth rates in the Gulf Stream can be suppressed by adjacent topography and that eddy PV fluxes in the Gulf Stream's recirculation gyres can stir the DWBC [*(paper)*](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0206.1?journalCode=phoc).

* I am building a vorticity budget for the Gulf Stream, using observations and the [ECCO v4](http://www.ecco-group.org/) model. This work began in my thesis and is ongoing.
