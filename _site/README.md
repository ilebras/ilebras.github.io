# Minimal Jekyll Theme

Minimal Jekyll Theme is a two column, responsive Jekyll theme with large featured images and solid typography.  It is derived from the wonderful work of [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com). I loved his Minimal Mistakes theme, and have tried to tune it to my needs.

Few of the additions include:

* Support for multiple author attribution in a blog. This includes both different authors for various posts, as well as multiple authors per post.
* Switched to using the gorgeous textures of [Virginie Moerenhout](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yndra)

## Minimal Jeykll Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments --- content first.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Author sidebar to pimp your bio, photo[^1], and social media links.
* Simple and clear permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*


## Basic Setup for a new Jekyll site

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.


## License

I'm personally a fan of more liberal licenses, but this theme is a derivate of Michael's work, which was distributed under the [GNU General Public License](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/LICENSE) version 2 or later.
