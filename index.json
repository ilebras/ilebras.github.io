In order for these carbon- and oxygen-rich waters to ventilate the deep ocean and affect global climate, however, they must be transported away from their formation sites. In the Irminger Sea\u0026rsquo;s western boundary current system, there are three potential pathways for high-oxygen waters into the deep ocean: (1) The boundary current may be ventilated directly to depths greater than 500m via down-front wind forcing; (2) Labrador Sea Water (LSW), which forms via deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Basin interiors, drains into the boundary current; (3) Overflow waters spill over the Denmark Strait into the Irminger Sea, entraining LSW and other high-oxygen water masses along the way.\nUsing novel moored O2 measurements in the western Irminger Sea, we aim to quantify the amount of O2 that enters the boundary current through each pathway and elucidate the dynamics that govern each route. The moored O2 sensors were added to existing Overturning in the North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) moorings in summer 2020 in coordination with other O2 sensor deployments on OSNAP moorings across the Labrador Sea.

Four years of mooring data from the eastern Labrador Sea reveal persistent mesoscale variability in the West Greenland boundary current. Between 2014 and 2018, 197 middepth intensified cyclones were identified that passed the array near the 2000-m isobath. In this study, we quantify these features and show that they are the downstream manifestation of Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) cyclones. A composite cyclone is constructed revealing an average radius of 9 km, maximum azimuthal speed of 24 cm s-1, and a core propagation velocity of 27 cm s-1.Thecore propagation velocity is significantly smaller than upstream near Denmark Strait, allowing them to trap more water. The cyclones transport a 200-m-thick lens of dense water at the bottom of the water column and increase the transport of DSOW in the West Greenland boundary current by 17% relative to the background flow. Only a portion of the features generated at Denmark Strait make it to the Labrador Sea, implying that the remainder are shed into the interior Irminger Sea, are retroflected at Cape Farewell, or dissipate. A synoptic shipboard survey east of Cape Farewell, conducted in summer 2020, captured two of these features that shed further light on their structure and timing. This is the first time DSOW cyclones have been observed in the Labrador Sea—a discovery that could have important implications for interior stratification.","tags":["Boundary currents","Eddies","Transport"],"title":"Cyclonic Eddies in the West Greenland Boundary Current System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feili Li","M.

Yet there is neither clear observational evidence nor agreement among models about how changes in deep water formation influence overturning. Here, we use data from a trans-basin mooring array (OSNAP—Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) to show that winter convection during 2014–2018 in the interior basin had minimal impact on density changes in the deep western boundary currents in the subpolar basins. Contrary to previous modeling studies, we find no discernable relationship between western boundary changes and subpolar overturning variability over the observational time scales. Our results require a reconsideration of the notion of deep western boundary changes representing overturning characteristics, with implications for constraining the source of overturning variability within and downstream of the subpolar region. Western boundary current variability in the subpolar North Atlantic is thought to reflect interior convection changes and determine Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability. Here, the authors show with an extended OSNAP time series that neither linkage is robust due to the complex dynamics in the region.","tags":["Ocean sciences","Physical oceanography"],"title":"Subpolar North Atlantic western boundary density anomalies and the Meridional Overturning Circulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabela Le Bras","Fiamma Straneo","Morven Muilwijk","Lars H.

They may be mixed into the deep ocean as part of the overturning circulation, or flow alongside regions of deep water formation without impacting overturning. Climate models suggest that as increasing amounts of fresh water enter the Atlantic, the overturning circulation will be disrupted, yet we lack an understanding of how much fresh water is mixed into the overturning circulation's deep limb in the present day. To constrain these fresh water pathways, we build steady-state volume, salt, and heat budgets east of Greenland that are initialized with observations and closed using inverse methods. Fresh water sources are split into oceanic Polar Waters from the Arctic and surface fresh water fluxes, which include net precipitation, runoff, and ice melt, to examine how they imprint the circulation differently. We find that 65 mSv of the total 110 mSv of surface fresh water fluxes that enter our domain participate in the overturning circulation, as do 0.6 Sv of the total 1.2 Sv of Polar Waters that flow through Fram Strait. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the overturning circulation is more sensitive to future changes in Arctic fresh water outflow and precipitation, while Greenland runoff and iceberg melt are more likely to stay along the coast of Greenland.","tags":["arctic","circulation","conservation equations","inverse methods","meridional overturning circulation","north atlantic ocean","ocean"],"title":"How much Arctic fresh water participates in the subpolar overturning circulation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Astrid Pacini","Robert S.

The boundary current system is comprised of three components: the West Greenland Coastal Current, which advects cold and fresh Upper Polar Water (UPW); the West Greenland Current, which transports warm and salty Irminger Water (IW) along the upper slope and UPW at the surface; and the Deep Western Boundary Current, which advects dense overflow waters. Labrador Sea Water (LSW) is prevalent at the seaward side of the array within an offshore recirculation gyre and at the base of the West Greenland Current. The 4-yr mean transport of the full boundary current system is 31.1 ± 7.4 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1), with no clear seasonal signal. However, the individual water mass components exhibit seasonal cycles in hydrographic properties and transport. LSW penetrates the boundary current locally, through entrainment/mixing from the adjacent recirculation gyre, and also enters the current upstream in the Irminger Sea. IW is modified through air–sea interaction during winter along the length of its trajectory around the Irminger Sea, which converts some of the water to LSW. This, together with the seasonal increase in LSW entering the current, results in an anticorrelation in transport between these two water masses. The seasonality in UPW transport can be explained by remote wind forcing and subsequent adjustment via coastal trapped waves. Our results provide the first quantitatively robust observational description of the boundary current in the eastern Labrador Sea.","tags":null,"title":"Mean Conditions and Seasonality of the West Greenland Boundary Current System near Cape Farewell","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Observing ocean circulation"],"categories":null,"content":"The subpolar North Atlantic Ocean occupies a key role in regional and global climate, yet is poorly represented in climate models, which limits our confidence in predictions.

The AMOC, in turn, is thought to be sensitive to changes in climate [IPCC 2014]. However, the link between the AMOC and climate hinges on the assumption of meridional coherence, i.e. that the overturning circulation transports climate anomalies thousands of kilometers across the Atlantic basin. Though meridional coherence has been reported in ocean models, observations of the AMOC are too limited to test the role of the overturning circulation in the climate system on interannual time scales.\nTo investigate AMOC connectivity from observations, we will compile a novel dataset at 37N. We plan to construct a decade-long (2004-2014), cross-basin dataset by combining complementary data types: satellite altimetry, gravity and wind stress data, in situ float observations, and the Line W western boundary moored array [Willis and Fu 2008, Toole et al. 2017]. The ECCO v4 and LLC270 state estimates will be used to complement our analysis and test our methods.\nOur objectives are to use the 37N dataset to:\nclarify the effect of subpolar density anomalies on the subtropical AMOC,\ndiagnose the gyre and overturning circulation contributions to subtropical heat divergence, and\ninvestigate basin-wide AMOC coherence on interannual time scales during the satellite-era.\nUltimately, this work will clarify the role of the AMOC in the climate system. The 37N dataset will be particularly well suited to address these questions because the western boundary currents and deep ocean are directly measured, improving upon a satellite- and float-based AMOC dataset at 41N [Willis 2010]. The Willis [2010] 41N AMOC estimate does not include any observations below 2000m, has limited spatial and temporal resolution, and is situated just north of the subtropical gyre, which limits the scope of scientific questions it can be used to address.\nThe 37N dataset would provide the oceanographic community with a full-depth AMOC dataset that complements existing cross-basin arrays: OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) at 57N, and RAPID (Rapid Climate Change) at 26.5N. This project will expand our understanding of the basin-wide character of the overturning circulation and its associated heat transport, as well as ground truth ocean models. Our methods for merging satellite and in situ observations may be applicable to other ocean regions, which would substantially increase the scope of the global overturning circulation observing system.\nFunded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) Physical Oceanography program.

The 1.8 year averaged transport of water denser than $σ$$þeta$ = 27.8 kg m‐3 was ‐10.8 ± 4.9 Sv (mean ± 1 std; 1 Sv = 106 m3 s‐1). Of this total, we find ‐4.1 ± 1.4 Sv within the densest layer ($σ$$þeta$ textgreater 27.88 kg m‐3) that originated from the Denmark Strait Overflow. The lighter North East Atlantic Deep Water layer ($σ$$þeta$ = 27.8‐27.88 kg m‐3) carries ‐6.5 ± 7.7 Sv. The variability in transport ranges between 2 and 65 days. There is a distinct shift from high to low frequency with distance from the East Greenland slope. High frequency fluctuations (2‐8 days) close to the continental slope are likely associated with topographic Rossby waves and/or cyclonic eddies. Here, perturbations in layer thickness make a significant (20‐60%) contribution to transport variability. In deeper water, toward the centre of the Irminger Basin, transport variance at 55 days dominates. Our results suggest that there has been a 1.8 Sv increase in total transport since 2005‐2006, but this difference can be accounted for by a range of methodological and data limitation biases.","tags":["Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation","Deep Western Boundary Current","Irminger Sea","mooring array","transport variability"],"title":"Transport variability of the Irminger Sea Deep Western Boundary Current from a mooring array","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The first 21-month record reveals a highly variable overturning circulation responsible for the majority of the heat and freshwater transport across the OSNAP line. In a departure from the prevailing view that changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea dominate MOC variability, these results suggest that the conversion of warm, salty, shallow Atlantic waters into colder, fresher, deep waters that move southward in the Irminger and Iceland basins is largely responsible for overturning and its variability in the subpolar basin.","tags":null,"title":"A sea change in our view of overturning in the subpolar North Atlantic.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabela Alexander-Astiz Le Bras","Maike Sonnewald","John M.

The hydrographic dataset at the center of this work is the A22 WOCE section, which lies along 668W and creates a closed volume with the North and South American coasts to its west. The planetary vorticity flux across A22 is quantified, providing a metric for the net meridional flow in the western subtropical gyre. The wind stress forcing over the subtropical gyre to the west and east of the A22 section is calculated from several wind stress data products. These observational budget terms are found to be consistent with an approximate barotropic Sverdrup balance in the eastern subtropical gyre and are on the same order as budget terms in the ECCO state estimate. The ECCO vorticity budget is closed by bottom pressure torques in the western subtropical gyre, which is consistent with previous studies. In sum, the analysis provides observational ground truth for the North Atlantic subtropical vorticity balance and explores the seasonal variability of this balance for the first time using the ECCO state estimate. This balance is found to hold on monthly time scales in ECCO, suggesting that the integrated subtropical gyre responds to forcing through fast barotropic adjustment.","tags":null,"title":"A barotropic vorticity budget for the subtropical north atlantic based on observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabela Astiz Le Bras","Fiamma Straneo","James Holte","N Penny Holliday"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"90180a1ec22b22bb2e8ef0333bc0a127","permalink":"https://ilebras.github.io/publication/le-bras-2018-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-13T15:36:35.045221Z","relpermalink":"/publication/le-bras-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["currents","freshwater","water masses"],"title":"Seasonality of Freshwater in the East Greenland Current System From 2014 to 2016","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
