These water formation sites are the windows through which gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen are transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean interior. While traditionally the Labrador Sea has been considered the primary location for convective mixing and gas uptake in the subpolar North Atlantic, in recent years deep convection has also occurred in the Irminger Sea, and observations have shown that processes in the Irminger Sea play a significant role in meridional overturning circulation variability. The variability in carbon dioxide and oxygen uptake in the region is likely also significant, yet has not been characterized to the extent that heat and freshwater fluxes have. The goal of work proposed here is to use observations from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Irminger Sea Global Node together with shipboard and profiling float observations to obtain a basin-wide view of oxygen cycling on seasonal to interannual time scales. We focus on oxygen as it is by far the most sampled biogeochemical variable in the region.\nThis project is a new interdisciplinary collaboration between Isabela Le Bras, Roo Nicholson (WHOI), Hilary Palevsky (BC) and Leah McRaven (WHOI).

The AMOC, in turn, is thought to be sensitive to changes in climate [IPCC 2014]. However, the link between the AMOC and climate hinges on the assumption of meridional coherence, i.e. that the overturning circulation transports climate anomalies thousands of kilometers across the Atlantic basin. Though meridional coherence has been reported in ocean models, observations of the AMOC are too limited to test the role of the overturning circulation in the climate system on interannual time scales.\nTo investigate AMOC connectivity from observations, we will compile a novel dataset at 37N. We plan to construct a decade-long (2004-2014), cross-basin dataset by combining complementary data types: satellite altimetry, gravity and wind stress data, in situ float observations, and the Line W western boundary moored array [Willis and Fu 2008, Toole et al. 2017]. The ECCO v4 and LLC270 state estimates will be used to complement our analysis and test our methods.\nOur objectives are to use the 37N dataset to:\n  clarify the effect of subpolar density anomalies on the subtropical AMOC,\n  diagnose the gyre and overturning circulation contributions to subtropical heat divergence, and\n  investigate basin-wide AMOC coherence on interannual time scales during the satellite-era.\n  Ultimately, this work will clarify the role of the AMOC in the climate system. The 37N dataset will be particularly well suited to address these questions because the western boundary currents and deep ocean are directly measured, improving upon a satellite- and float-based AMOC dataset at 41N [Willis 2010]. The Willis [2010] 41N AMOC estimate does not include any observations below 2000m, has limited spatial and temporal resolution, and is situated just north of the subtropical gyre, which limits the scope of scientific questions it can be used to address.\nThe 37N dataset would provide the oceanographic community with a full-depth AMOC dataset that complements existing cross-basin arrays: OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) at 57N, and RAPID (Rapid Climate Change) at 26.5N. This project will expand our understanding of the basin-wide character of the overturning circulation and its associated heat transport, as well as ground truth ocean models. Our methods for merging satellite and in situ observations may be applicable to other ocean regions, which would substantially increase the scope of the global overturning circulation observing system.\nFunded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) Physical Oceanography program.

From novel mooring observations in the Irminger Sea (2014–2016), we describe two water masses that are formed by convection and show that they have different rates of export in the western boundary current. Upper Irminger Sea Intermediate Water appears to form near the boundary current and is exported rapidly within 3 months of its formation. Deep Irminger Sea Intermediate Water forms in the basin interior and is exported on longer time scales. The subduction of these waters into the boundary current is consistent with an eddy transport mechanism. Our results suggest that light intermediate waters can contribute to overturning as much as waters formed by deeper convection and that the export time scales of both project onto overturning variability.","tags":["North Atlantic","convection","eddy processes","high latitude","overturning","subpolar circulation"],"title":"Rapid Export of Waters Formed by Convection Near the Irminger Sea's Western Boundary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleanor Frajka-Williams","Isabelle J.

Climate models indicate that changes to the AMOC both herald and drive climate shifts. Intensive trans-basin AMOC observational systems have been put in place to continuously monitor meridional volume transport variability, and in some cases, heat, freshwater and carbon transport. These observational programs have been used to diagnose the magnitude and origins of transport variability, and to investigate impacts of variability on essential climate variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and coastal sea level. AMOC observing approaches vary between the different systems, ranging from trans-basin arrays (OSNAP, RAPID 26 N, 11 S, SAMBA 34.5 N) to arrays concentrating on western boundaries (e.g., RAPID WAVE, MOVE 16 N). In this paper, we outline the different approaches (aims, strengths and limitations) and summarize the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure, and hydrography from Lagrangian floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches, state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches, we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC and its role in global climate.","tags":["Carbon Storage","Meridional overturning circulation (MOC)","Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE)","Thermohaline circulation (THC)","ocean heat content (OHC)"],"title":"Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Observed Transport and Variability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.E.

Here, a mooring array deployed at 60°N in the Irminger Sea, between 2014 and 2016 provides the longest continuous record of total DWBC volume transport at this latitude. The 1.8 year averaged transport of water denser than $σ$$þeta$ = 27.8 kg m‐3 was ‐10.8 ± 4.9 Sv (mean ± 1 std; 1 Sv = 106 m3 s‐1). Of this total, we find ‐4.1 ± 1.4 Sv within the densest layer ($σ$$þeta$ textgreater 27.88 kg m‐3) that originated from the Denmark Strait Overflow. The lighter North East Atlantic Deep Water layer ($σ$$þeta$ = 27.8‐27.88 kg m‐3) carries ‐6.5 ± 7.7 Sv. The variability in transport ranges between 2 and 65 days. There is a distinct shift from high to low frequency with distance from the East Greenland slope. High frequency fluctuations (2‐8 days) close to the continental slope are likely associated with topographic Rossby waves and/or cyclonic eddies. Here, perturbations in layer thickness make a significant (20‐60%) contribution to transport variability. In deeper water, toward the centre of the Irminger Basin, transport variance at 55 days dominates. Our results suggest that there has been a 1.8 Sv increase in total transport since 2005‐2006, but this difference can be accounted for by a range of methodological and data limitation biases.","tags":["Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation","Deep Western Boundary Current","Irminger Sea","mooring array","transport variability"],"title":"Transport variability of the Irminger Sea Deep Western Boundary Current from a mooring array","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M S Lozier","F Li","S Bacon","F Bahr","A S Bower","S A Cunningham","M F de Jong","L de Steur","B DeYoung","J Fischer","S F Gary","B J W Greenan","N P Holliday","A Houk","L Houpert","M E Inall","W E Johns","H L Johnson","C Johnson","J Karstensen","G Koman","I A Le Bras","X Lin","N Mackay","D P Marshall","H Mercier","M Oltmanns","R S Pickart","A L Ramsey","D Rayner","F Straneo","V Thierry","D J Torres","R G Williams","C Wilson","J Yang","I Yashayaev","J Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"fc7b5490c5439ac02d1638c99acac05d","permalink":"ilebras.github.io/publication/lozier-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T14:32:24.516667Z","relpermalink":"ilebras.github.io/publication/lozier-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"To provide an observational basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of a slowing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the 21st century, the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) observing system was launched in the summer of 2014.
